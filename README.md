## 📝 Description

This page is an analytical tool I created for my friends (and myself) to guess the settings of the Japanese gambling game "Pachisuro".

## 📝 How to use

1. Go to PACHINKO hall and find the machine you want to play.
2. Pay 100,000 yen.
3. Lost all the money.
4. Well, you can't play anymore. So, go home.
